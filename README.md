# WIP Shader Viewer Project  

This is a webpage where you can upload images and videos (possibly meshes in the future?)  
and you'll be able to select a preset of my shaders to apply to them.  
To-do:  
- let people write their own shaders?  
- first images  
- Then videos  
- then meshes  
- add css styling and stuff
